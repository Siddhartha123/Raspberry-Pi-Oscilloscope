# Raspberry Pi Oscilloscope


This project aims at developing a bare metal digital oscilloscope software tool that the uses Raspberry Pi bare metal environment [circle-stdlib](https://github.com/smuehlst/circle-stdlib) which is based on [circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle).
For measuring voltage signals I have used an ADC ([TLC2543](http://www.ti.com/product/TLC2543) from Texas Instruments).
